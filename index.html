	<p>This is Qamar. My background is this : I graduated from IIIT-H in Computer Science, was a
	research fellow at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, worked at Housing.com and Software
	AG.</p>

        <p>While I was working at Software AG in Hyderabad I had a skull fracture, frontal temporal
	bone got fractured. I had to leave everything, went to the Himalayas(taught monks English
	and kids subjects). Then landed on the roads and terrible stuff have happened. Most of my
	stuff got stolen and I got thrashed quite a lot of times.</p>

        <p>Right now I need some work/internship (any thing related to data, computers or anything
	else) to help me get back up. (I am quite decent in algorithms and the data science aspects
	    of things but right now I am open to anything) I am nearly on the roads and got
	    beaten up quite a bit. Having some work will help me get back up.</p>
